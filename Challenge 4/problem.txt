Imaging you've been handed a dataset where:

-> Dates are stored as strings (e.g., '2024-06-09')
-> Numerical values are mixed with text (e.g., '42 items')
-> Booleans are represented as 0s and 1s

and your task is to transform this messy data into a clean, usable format.

Tasks:
-> SQL: Write a query to convert date strings to DATE format, extract numbers from mixed columns, and turn 0/1 values into TRUE/FALSE.
-> Pandas: Replicate your SQL solution using Pandas DataFrames and appropriate type conversion methods.
