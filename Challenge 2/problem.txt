Challenge:
Imagine a Pandas DataFrame (df) with a 'cash_flow' column representing daily cash flow aggregates.

Goal:
We want to keep only the rows with unique consecutive daily cash flow values. This ensures the model captures trends and predicts future cash flow more accurately.

For example:
df = pd.DataFrame({'cash_flow': [1000, 1000, 1000, 1500, 1500, 1000, 1200, 1200, 1800, 1800]})

Desired output: [1000, 1500, 1000, 1200, 1800]

solve this using Pandas to ensure the cash flow forecasting model receives accurate information
Use your Pandas skills to filter the DataFrame df and keep only the rows with unique consecutive cash flow values.
