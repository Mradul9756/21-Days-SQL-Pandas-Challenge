Scenario
You're an analyst at a financial institution. Your task is to identify accounts at risk of churning (closing or becoming inactive) and understand their transaction behavior. You have access to two tables:

ACCOUNTS						TRANSACTIONS

account_id INT  PRIMARY KEY		      transaction_id INT  PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INT,		            account_id INT,
account_type VARCHAR,			      transaction_date DATE,
open_date VARCHAR,				amount DECIMAL
Status VARCHAR,					transaction_type VARCHAR

Tasks:
1. Categorize Account Activity: Use ‘CASE WHEN’ to categorize accounts into three groups based on their average monthly transaction count over the past year:
    * High Activity: Average of 20 or more transactions per month
    * Medium Activity: Average of 10-19 transactions per month
    * Low Activity: Average of less than 9 transactions per month
2. Identify Churn Risk:
    * Use WHERE to filter for accounts that have been inactive for the past three months (status = 'inactive').
    * Use HAVING (after aggregating transactions by account) to find accounts in the 'Low Activity' category.
3. Analyze Transaction Patterns: For the accounts identified as high-risk churn candidates:
    * Calculate the average transaction amount for each transaction type (deposit vs. withdrawal) over the past six months.
    * Determine the most frequent transaction type for each account.
Expected Output:
Your analysis should provide insights like:
* The number and percentage of accounts in each activity category.
* The number and percentage of accounts identified as high-risk churn candidates.
* A breakdown of average transaction amounts and most frequent transaction types for high-risk accounts.
