## Power of SQL's dynamic trio â€“ CASE WHEN, WHERE, and HAVING

### CASE WHEN: 
Think of this like a "choose your own adventure" story for your data. It lets you create different paths based on certain conditions.

### WHERE: 
This is like putting on a pair of X-ray glasses that let you see only the parts of the data you care about.

### HAVING: 
This is like a magnifying glass that zooms in on patterns in your data after it's been grouped together.
