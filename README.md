# 21-Days-SQL-Pandas-Challenge
Confession time: I'm a bit of a data nerd. (Okay, maybe more than a bit.) And like many data folks, I spend a lot of time wrangling data in SQL and Pandas. It can be a grind, but it's also where the magic happens - insights, decisions, real-world impact.

𝗦𝗼, 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝗻? For the next 21 days, I'm inviting you on a journey to level up our SQL and Pandas chops together.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 (𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼):
𝗝𝗼𝗯 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: Nail those technical interviews.
𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Sharpen your skills and discover new tricks.
𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀: Learn the fundamentals of working with data – it's more useful than you might think!

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲:
𝗗𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝘀𝗲: One SQL challenge, one Pandas challenge. Bite-sized but impactful. It's easier to retain info when you’re not cramming it all at once.
𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 Focused: I'll share stories (and maybe a few scars) from my own data adventures.
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝘀: These are the essential topics frequently used by data developers in almost every organization.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁: I’ll be solving these problems too, sharing my solutions and why I chose them. Feel free to fork my GitHub Repository.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 21 𝗗𝗮𝘆𝘀?
It's about building a habit. Science says it takes about 3 weeks for something to stick. Plus, it's way more fun when you’re not doing it alone.

𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱:
𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗲: I'll post the daily challenges right here.
𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Show off your skills in the comments.
𝗧𝗮𝗴 𝗮 𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱: Invite them to join the fun!

𝗠𝘆 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆:
I use SQL and Pandas daily at my work, tackling real-world data challenges. Through this series, I'll share not just the problems, but also my solutions and the reasoning behind them. It's a unique opportunity to learn from hands-on experiences. 

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜'𝗺 𝗗𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀:
I'm constantly learning and refining my data toolkit. This challenge is my way of paying it forward and building a community of data enthusiasts.
