You have a "web_events" table:

event_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT,
timestamp TIMESTAMP,
event_type VARCHAR(50), 
page_url VARCHAR(255)

Each row track a user interaction (page views, clicks, etc.).

End Goal:
Find users who completed this specific sequence of events:
-> Viewed the homepage
-> Viewed a product page
-> Added an item to their cart

Strategy:
-> CTE: Create a CTE to rank each user's events by timestamp.
-> Self-JOIN: Join the CTE to itself, matching on user_id and ensuring each subsequent event is one rank higher.
-> Filter: Keep only rows where the event sequence matches our target pattern (homepage view -> product view -> add to cart).

Result:
A result set showing the user_ids who completed the sequence, along with the timestamps of each event.
