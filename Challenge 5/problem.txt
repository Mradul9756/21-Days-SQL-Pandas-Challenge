A financial scenario (Asked in a Chime's technical interview):

you're working with a transactional data. They have a large fact table called FACT_TRANSACTIONS that's growing rapidly. The company wants to improve query performance on this table.

The Question:

Currently, the FACT_TRANSACTIONS table includes a column called transaction_category_name. This column is causing performance issues because it leads to large text comparisons in queries.

Now try to propose a solution using STAR schema principles to improve query performance on this table in Snowflake. Write the SQL statements necessary to implement your solution.

Hint: Think about the features of a Fact Table?
